# AE-EventAnalysis-RScript
This repository contains an R script to process and analyze adverse event (AE) data from clinical studies. The script reads the AE_data.csv file, calculates key metrics (Total AEs, SAEs, Related AEs, and more), filters participants based on form status, and aggregates results by site. The output is saved as a CSV file (AE_output.csv). Includes site mapping, form status filtering, and treatment relation classification for robust analysis.
